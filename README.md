# Incremental Box Placement (IBP)
In this paper the Incremental Box Placement (IBP) problem is defined, which is similar to an incremental version of the two-dimensional Bin Packing (2BP) problem. The primary goal of the thesis was to find the best algorithm for the IBP problem. To this end, common metaheuristics, Simulated Annealing and Particle Swarm Optimization, were implemented, a tailor-made algorithm was designed and created and a web dashboard application with testing and visualization features was built. All the algorithms were also specifically tuned for the IBP problem. It was concluded that Simulated Annealing performed the best in both the score and time metrics, notwithstanding some incidental unintended behavior by the algorithm. This behavior can be ascribed to the design of the performance metrics, which influences algorithm behavior. The custom-made algorithm called Adaptive Structure Optimization used targeting and propagation to improve on the base (1 + 1) algorithm, but did not manage to best Simulated Annealing in the defined performance metrics.
